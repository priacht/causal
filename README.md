# causal

This is a literature search sort of document with some examples and some things I want to try.  The focus is on causal 
search in the context of graphical models, particularly ancestral models, and I am mostly interested in nonparametric methods and 
sensitivity of parametric methods to misspecification.  I would also really like to understand how to use non-iid data like 
survey data and data from multiple sources.  Another special area is about ways to improve the search;  I am not happy with 
the properties of just spamming a data set with hypothesis tests, which is kind of what the current constraint-based methods do.
