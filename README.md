# causal

This is a literature search sort of document with some examples and some things I want to try.  The focus is on causal 
search in the context of graphical models, particularly ancestral models, and I am mostly interested in nonparametric methods and 
sensitivity of parametric methods to misspecification.  I would also really like to understand how to use non-iid data like 
survey data and data from multiple sources.
